164	|	Substitute	|	Transfers 1/4 the user's max HP into a doll that absorbs damage and causes most negative move effects to fail.  If the user leaves the field, the doll will vanish.  If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.	|		|		|	10
165	|	Struggle	|	Inflicts typeless regular damage.  User takes 1/4 its max HP in recoil.  Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.  This move is used automatically when a Pokémon cannot use any other move legally, e.g., due to having no PP remaining or being under the effect of both encore and torment at the same time.  This move's recoil is not treated as recoil for the purposes of anything that affects recoil, such as the ability rock head.  It also is not prevented by magic guard.  This move cannot be copied by mimic, mirror move, or sketch, nor selected by assist or metronome, nor forced by encore.	|	50	|		|	1

167	|	Triple-Kick	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Hits three times in the same turn.  The second hit has double power, and the third hit has triple power.  Each hit has a separate accuracy check, and this move stops if a hit misses.  skill link does not apply.	|	10	|	90	|	10
168	|	Thief	|	Inflicts regular damage.  If the target is holding an item and the user is not, the user will permanently take the item.  Damage is still inflicted if an item cannot be taken.  Pokémon with sticky hold or multitype are immune to the item theft effect.  The target cannot recover its item with recycle.  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.	|	60	|	100	|	25
169	|	Spider-Web	|	The target cannot switch out normally.  Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.  This effect ends when the user leaves the field.  The target may still escape by using baton pass, u turn, or a shed shell.  Both the user and the target pass on this effect with baton pass.	|		|		|	10
170	|	Mind-Reader	|	If the user targets the same target again before the end of the next turn, the move it uses is guaranteed to hit.  This move itself also ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.  One-hit KO moves are also guaranteed to hit, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  This effect also allows the user to hit Pokémon that are off the field due to moves such as dig or fly.  If the target uses detect or protect while under the effect of this move, the user is not guaranteed to hit, but has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection.

This move cannot be copied by mirror move.	|		|		|	10
175	|	Flail	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Power varies inversely with the user's proportional remaining HP.  64 * current HP / max HP | Power -----------------------: | ----:  0– 1                    |  200  2– 5                    |  150  6–12                    |  100 13–21                    |   80 22–42                    |   40 43–64                    |   20 	|		|	100	|	15
176	|	Conversion-2	|	Changes the user's type to a type either resistant or immune to the last damaging move that hit it.  The new type is selected at random and cannot be a type the user already is.  If there is no eligible new type, this move will fail.	|		|		|	30

180	|	Spite	|	Lowers the PP of the target's last used move by 4.  If the target hasn't used a move since entering the field, if it tried to use a move this turn and failed, or if its last used move has 0 PP remaining, this move will fail.	|		|	100	|	10

227	|	Encore	|	The next 4–8 times (selected at random) the target attempts to move, it is forced to repeat its last used move.  If the selected move allows the trainer to select a target, an opponent will be selected at random each turn.  If the target is prevented from using the selected move by some other effect, struggle will be used instead.  This effect ends if the selected move runs out of PP.  If the target hasn't used a move since entering the field, if it tried to use a move this turn and failed, if it does not know the selected move, or if the selected move has 0 PP remaining, this move will fail.  If the target's last used move was encore, mimic, mirror move, sketch, struggle, or transform, this move will fail.	|		|	100	|	5
228	|	Pursuit	|	Inflicts regular damage.  If the target attempts to switch out this turn before the user acts, this move hits the target before it leaves and has double power.  This effect can still hit a Pokémon that switches out when it has a substitute up or when an ally has used follow me.	|	40	|	100	|	20
229	|	Rapid-Spin	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Removes leech seed from the user, frees the user from bind, clamp, fire spin, magma storm, sand tomb, whirlpool, and wrap, and clears spikes, stealth rock, and toxic spikes from the user's side of the field.

237	|	Hidden-Power	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Power and type are determined by the user's IVs.  Power is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`.  `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the IV for each of Special Defense, Special Attack, Speed, Defense, Attack, and HP in that order.  (Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.)  Power is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.  Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.  Value | Type ----: | --------     0 | fighting     1 | flying     2 | poison     3 | ground     4 | rock     5 | bug     6 | ghost     7 | steel     8 | fire     9 | water    10 | grass    11 | electric    12 | psychic    13 | ice    14 | dragon    15 | dark  This move thus cannot be normal.  Most other types have an equal 1/16 chance to be selected, given random IVs.  However, due to the flooring used here, bug, fighting, and grass appear 5/64 of the time, and dark only 1/64 of the time.	|	60	|	100	|	15

248	|	Future-Sight	|	Inflicts typeless regular damage at the end of the third turn, starting with this one.  This move cannot score a critical hit.  If the target switches out, its replacement will be hit instead.  Damage is calculated at the time this move is used; stat changes and switching out during the delay won't change the damage inflicted.  No move with this effect can be used against the same target again until after the end of the third turn.  This effect breaks through wonder guard.  If the target is protected by protect or detect on the turn this move is used, this move will fail.  However, the damage on the third turn will break through protection.  The damage is applied at the end of the turn, so it ignores endure and focus sash.  This move cannot be copied by mirror move.	|	120	|	100	|	10

251	|	Beat-Up	|	Inflicts typeless regular damage.  Every Pokémon in the user's party, excepting those that have fainted or have a major status effect, attacks the target.

254	|	Stockpile	|	Raises the user's Defense and Special Defense by one stage each.  Stores energy for use with spit up and swallow.  Up to three levels of energy can be stored, and all are lost if the user leaves the field.  Energy is still stored even if the stat boosts cannot be applied.  If the user uses baton pass, the stat boosts are passed as normal, but the stored energy is not.	|		|		|	20
255	|	Spit-Up	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Power is equal to 100 times the amount of energy stored by stockpile.  Ignores the random factor in the damage formula.

This move cannot be copied by mirror move.	|		|	100	|	10
256	|	Swallow	|	Heals the user depending on the amount of energy stored by stockpile: 1/4 its max HP after one use, 1/2 its max HP after two uses, or fully after three uses.  Stored energy is consumed, and the user's Defense and Special Defense are reset to what they would be if stockpile had not been used.  If the user has no energy stored, this move will fail.	|		|		|	10
257	|	Heat-Wave	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Has a 10% chance to burn the target.	|	95	|	90	|	10

If the user is holding icy rock, this effect lasts for eight turns.  blizzard has 100% accuracy.  If the target has used detect or protect, blizzard has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection.  moonlight, morning sun, and synthesis heal only 1/4 of the user's max HP.  Pokémon with snow cloak are exempt from this effect's damage.	|		|		|	10
259	|	Torment	|	Prevents the target from attempting to use the same move twice in a row.  When the target leaves the field, this effect ends.  If the target is forced to attempt a repeated move due to choice band, choice scarf, choice specs, disable, encore, taunt, only having PP remaining for one move, or any other effect, the target will use struggle instead.

264	|	Focus-Punch	|	Inflicts regular damage.  If the user takes damage this turn before hitting, this move will fail.  This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist, metronome, or sleep talk.	|	150	|	100	|	20

If the user's ally switches out, opposing Pokémon may still hit it with pursuit.  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.	|		|		|	20
267	|	Nature-Power	|	Uses another move chosen according to the terrain.

268	|	Charge	|	Raises the user's Special Defense by one stage.  If the user uses an electric move next turn, its power will be doubled.	|		|		|	20
269	|	Taunt	|	Target is forced to only use damaging moves for the next 3–5 turns, selected at random.  Moves that select other moves not known in advance do not count as damaging.  assist, copycat, me first, metronome, mirror move, and sleep talk do not directly inflict damage and thus may not be used.  bide, counter, endeavor, metal burst, and mirror coat are allowed.	|		|	100	|	20

If either Pokémon has multitype or sticky hold, this move will fail.  If this move results in a Pokémon obtaining choice band, choice scarf, or choice specs, and that Pokémon was the latter of the pair to move this turn, then the move it used this turn becomes its chosen forced move.  This applies even if both Pokémon had a choice item before this move was used.  If the first of the two Pokémon gains a choice item, it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn.  Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.	|		|	100	|	10

This move cannot be copied by mirror move.	|		|		|	15

282	|	Knock-Off	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Target loses its held item.  Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.  If the target has multitype or sticky hold, it will take damage but not lose its item.	|	65	|	100	|	20

284	|	Eruption	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Power increases with the user's remaining HP and is given by `150 * HP / max HP`, to a maximum of 150 when the user has full HP.	|	150	|	100	|	5

289	|	Snatch	|	The next time a Pokémon uses a beneficial move on itself or itself and its ally this turn, the user of this move will steal the move and use it itself.  Moves which may be stolen by this move are identified by the "snatchable" flag.  If two Pokémon use this move on the same turn, the faster Pokémon will steal the first beneficial move, and the slower Pokémon will then steal it again—thus, only the slowest Pokémon using this move ultimately gains a stolen move's effect.  If the user steals psych up, it will target the Pokémon that used psych up.  If the user was the original target of psych up, and the Pokémon that originally used it's affected by pressure, it will only lose 1 PP.  This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome.	|		|		|	10

However, they will not give this move a chance to break through detect or protect.	|	120	|	100	|	5

912	|	Hard-Press	|	Transfers 1/4 the user's max HP into a doll that absorbs damage and causes most negative move effects to fail.  If the user leaves the field, the doll will vanish.  If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.	|	0	|	100	|	10
913	|	Dragon-Cheer	|	Inflicts typeless regular damage.  User takes 1/4 its max HP in recoil.  Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.  This move is used automatically when a Pokémon cannot use any other move legally, e.g., due to having no PP remaining or being under the effect of both encore and torment at the same time.  This move's recoil is not treated as recoil for the purposes of anything that affects recoil, such as the ability rock head.  It also is not prevented by magic guard.  This move cannot be copied by mimic, mirror move, or sketch, nor selected by assist or metronome, nor forced by encore.	|	0	|	0	|	15
914	|	Alluring-Voice	|	Permanently replaces itself with the target's last used move.  If that move is chatter or struggle, this move will fail.  This move cannot be copied by mimic or mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome, nor forced by encore.	|	80	|	100	|	10
915	|	Temper-Flare	|	Inflicts regular damage.  Hits three times in the same turn.  The second hit has double power, and the third hit has triple power.  Each hit has a separate accuracy check, and this move stops if a hit misses.  skill link does not apply.	|	75	|	100	|	10
916	|	Supercell-Slam	|	Inflicts regular damage.  If the target is holding an item and the user is not, the user will permanently take the item.  Damage is still inflicted if an item cannot be taken.  Pokémon with sticky hold or multitype are immune to the item theft effect.  The target cannot recover its item with recycle.  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.	|	100	|	95	|	15
917	|	Psychic-Noise	|	The target cannot switch out normally.  Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.  This effect ends when the user leaves the field.  The target may still escape by using baton pass, u turn, or a shed shell.  Both the user and the target pass on this effect with baton pass.	|	75	|	100	|	10
918	|	Upper-Hand	|	If the user targets the same target again before the end of the next turn, the move it uses is guaranteed to hit.  This move itself also ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.  One-hit KO moves are also guaranteed to hit, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  This effect also allows the user to hit Pokémon that are off the field due to moves such as dig or fly.  If the target uses detect or protect while under the effect of this move, the user is not guaranteed to hit, but has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection.  This effect is passed on by baton pass.	|	65	|	100	|	15
919	|	Malignant-Chain	|	Only works on sleeping Pokémon.  Gives the target a nightmare, damaging it for 1/4 its max HP every turn.  If the target wakes up or leaves the field, this effect ends.	|	100	|	100	|	5
